# Java Algorithms and Data Structures

I have created this repository to share some developments of data structures and algorithms than I practiced during my studies, works or just for fun. I tried to make all data structures/algorithms from the most generic and unit tested way as possible.

## Implementations

### Mathematics
* Factorial (recursively and iteratively implementations)
* Fibonacci number (recursively and iteratively implementations)
* Prime number (Sieve of Eratosthenes)

### Trees
* Binary Search Tree
  + in depth traversal (pre/in/post order)
  + in breadth traversal

### Sort
* Bogosort
* QuickSort

### String
 * Levenshtein distance
