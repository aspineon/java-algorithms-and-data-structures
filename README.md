# Java Algorithms and Data Structures

I have created this repository to share some developments of data structures and algorithms than I practiced during my studies, works or just for fun. I tried to make all data structures/algorithmss from the most generic and unit tested way as possible.

## Implementations
* Factorial (recursively and iteratively implementations)
* Fibonacci Number (recursively and iteratively implementations)
* Binary Search Tree
